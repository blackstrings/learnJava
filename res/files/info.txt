notes
The worst case scenario we want to avoid is
1. create a story for contents that we don't already have.
2. create a story, using the audio, for which our contents don't match or support

choice
1. create a story following the audio
2. create a story based off our content

etc
there is always a first timer
positive next one will be better planned
