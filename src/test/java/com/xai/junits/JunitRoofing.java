	 * Gutter Estimate
	 * The junit is a little different from conventional Junits
	 * First you have a txt file that makes all the selections. These selections
	 * can be copied when debugging the app using the variables or expression window in eclipse
	 * The TestGutterEst.java will then load the specified txt at runtime and output the estimation.
	 * 
	 * Use the breakpoint assert to know what values and what variables will be output.
