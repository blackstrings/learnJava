		<h1>Fence</h1>
		<p>Fence is one of our legacy c++ applications. It is also one of the simplest application on our kiosks. It allows a guest to create a basic line drawing of what their fence layout will look like and create an estimate based on the products they selected. There are a wide range of choices to choose from.</p>
		<section>
			<h1>Special Notes</h1>
			<ul>	
				<li>Fence uses INI files for managing screen and telling the application what we want to see on the screen (btns, text, etc). In debug you will see a number ex: 200 on top left, so the file to manipulate that screen is in Step200.INI</li>
				<li>Can't access INI files inside VS6, use window browsers instead</li>
				<li>Adding/Deleting buttons are dynamic. If you increase the number of buttons on a page which exceeds the screen space availability, a 2nd screen will be generated automatically</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Terminology</h1>

			</ul>

			<h1>Side Stuff</h1>
			<ul>	
				<li>Preveious - go back</li>
				<li>Textbanner - to display any text you see (except button text)</li>
				<li>Each text you add, you have to also update the total count</li>
				<li>Two configuration: Release & Debug - we work in debug</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Debugging Fence Product SKUs</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
				If products aren't showing up, check to see if the store systems are down. For example check if sys1, 8888, 4444, 5555 is down for a specific fence sku by using a URL to see if you are getting null returns. Currently i don't know the url get it from team  member like dave b.
