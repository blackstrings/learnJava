			<h1>Good Practices</h1>
			<section>
				<p>Unity is built around components, so it is best to also build your scripts like components. Think modules. One script specifically does one task.
				Say you have a hero game object with hp, weapon, and inputs. You'd create 3 classes total to handle each of these components, and you put it on the gameobject</p>
				
				<p>
				Also think, interface. Build your classes around interfaces. For example, HP class should implement a Interface IDamagable if HP class is going to handle damaging system.
				HP class should also implement a 2nd, 3rd interface or more, if it is handling other functionalities that can be grouped as a category.
				Class A shouldn't have to access directly methods in Class B, but rather access an interface that class B has implemented.
				</p>

			<h1>Best Json parsers</h1>
			<section>
			<p>From best to least recommended. Json.net in terms of performance is the fastest 3rd party plugin.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Json.net = $25 - now works on webplayer, ios, android
					<ul>
						<li>Serialize from jsonStr straight into c# object</li>
						<li>Deserialize c# object straight into jsonStr</li>
						<li>Serialize jsonStr into Json object (JObject) just to get values</li>
						<li>Deserialize JObject into jsonObject</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>DataContractJsonSerializer - .net library - but more codes to do the conversion</li>
				<li>SimpleJSON free, simple converter</li>
				<li>Do not use the newtonsoft.json directly from .net as unity has some issues with it</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>IDE</h1>
			<section>
				<ul>
					<li>MonoDevelop - comes with Unity but getting better each year - small studios use it</li>
					<li>Visual Studio Express or Pro - bigger studios use this but only for Windows</li>
					<li>Visual Studio Unity Tools - comes with 5.2 only for Windows </li>
					<li>Xamarin</li>

			<h1>Quaternion</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
				Quaternion is a complex set of rotation that allows objects to rotate around in xyz axis. It defines an angle and a direction kinda.

			<h1>What to use: MonoBehaviour vs ScriptableObject vs Normal</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>Monobehaviour</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>When you want to attach to gameobjects, use unity editor gui, tweak public variables</li>
					<li>Allows you to utilize Start, Awake, Update, OnMouse...etc</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>ScriptableObject</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>When you only need to manage data and will need class to be serialize for saving</li>
					<li>Reason is because Unity uses special serialization unique only to Unity</li>
					<li>Avoid passing parameters to constructor, best to leave parameters empty, create init method if need to use parameter</li>
					<li>to create an instance using new</li>
					<li>instead do MyClass myClass = ScriptableObject.createInstance&lt;MyClass&gt;();</li>
					<li>Then follow up with myClass.init() if you wish to run a constructor on it, but don't create a true constructor for it</li>
					<li>ScriptableObject aren't meant to have a constructor the way it is built</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Normal classes</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The class does not need to be saved or serialized</li>
					<li>The class does not get attached to game objects</li>
					<li>The class is not referenced in a another class that will be serialized.</li>
					<li>Good for utility classes</li>
				</ul>

			<h1>Network Communication</h1>
			<section>
				<p>You have two options, get using WWW alone or post using WWWForm combined with WWW.
				To use the class, the instantiating class can't be static due to monobehaviour. 
				So create a class that can last throughout the app if you are doing scene loading.
				If you do not make a singleton class of this web call, when you load a scene, 
				it will stop/interrupt the current communication during a load scene.</p>
				<p>
				Webplayer and webGL builds using server calls must have a crossdomainpolicy.xml set at the root level of their domain within the server.
				Helpful links <a href="http://eyemyapps.com/wp/?p=146" target="_blank">Web comm1</a>. If you do this however, be extra careful that only
				 the correct game calls can talk to the server as doing this opens the portal for outside attacks.
				</p>
				<p>
				However, if the game is loaded from the same web server the data is in, this cross domain issue will not occur and will load data fine.

			<h1>WebGL Builds</h1>
			<section>
				<p>This build usually creates 30MB+ package folder due to all the c# conversion to javascript.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You need to have "write" access permission to your programFiles/Unity folder (contact DesktopSupport)
						<ul>
							<li>webGL builds some files to this very folder at buildtime</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Build Setting Configs
						<ul>
							<li>Unity 5.2+ - Build without having anything selected, not even dev mode - auto optimization in place</li>
							<li>Unity 5.1 - Build with fast build, stripping may be needed</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>When running webGL builds on your local machine, and unity is making a call to another server (stage, prod) 
					on another machine, you need to Allow the server to open security for cross-domain-policy, 
					put this file on the root directory of server
					</li>
					<div style="background-color:black; padding:10px; margin:0 15px 0 15px">
					&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; <br>
					&lt;cross-domain-policy&gt; &lt;allow-access-from domain=&quot;*&quot;/&gt; <br>
					&lt;allow-access-from secure=&quot;false&quot;/&gt; <br>
					&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;
					</div>
					<li>The alternative to this is, while making local builds, run your own local server so you don't have to worry about the crossdomainpolicy.xml
					file.</li>
					
					<li>If build breaks, try increasing memory to 512 and enable exceptions to full in public settings</li>
					
					<li>Avoid try catch statements, webGL seems to break in the try catch. If you want to use try catch, you'll have to enable debug mode so that web
					GL builds the exception package to the build, which is only good for debugging purposes.</li>
					
					<li>Full Screen Mode <a href="https://ocias.com/blog/full-browser-window-unity-webgl/" target="_blank">tutorial</a></li>

			<h1>Buttons</h1>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Dropdowns</h2>
				<p>Linking dynamic dropdown btns. to map the button to a method and carry over the selection, we use lambda expression, which allows us
					to create an annonymous expression and pass in arguments</p>
				<img src="images/unity-dropdownbtn.png" class="fit popup">
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>While Pressed</h2>
				<p>To trigger events while the button is pressed, add the event trigger to your button and choose onPointUp and onPointDown.</p>
				<p>Then attach a gameobject with the methods</p>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Smart Controllers</h2>
				<p>To be able to switch player and use different actions for the same controller, use the design pattern related to the adaptor
				 pattern. Don't directly hook up the buttons to a player game object.</p>

			<h1>Packaging Your Own DLL</h1>
			<section class="box">
				<p>The benefit of this is code reuse. If you update the library, the downside is that you will have to rebuild and deploy your dll.
				Also, code debug may or may not work as you won't be able to click on a code in the unity console to jump to the code. There seems like,
				 there is a way around this though.</p>
				<p>Use the IDE to do it, and include the UnityEngine.dll and UnityEditor.dll</p>
				<p>There is talk that you have to build two DLL, one to put into any urnity project folder except the Editor folder and another to put into the
				Unity Editor folder. This is when you are using scripts that will use the Unity Editor</p>
