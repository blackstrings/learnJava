		<h1>MCOM</h1>
		<p>Stands for Menards.com. It is the main website that Menards uses for customers to shop. The entire site is built using the Java programing language.</p>
		<p>The importance of MCOM is that our applications, as we convert them to webpps, have started and will eventually pull product data directly off from MCOM's data server rather than off from our internal data servers through sockets.
		</p>

			<h1>Highlights</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Uses catagories (tables) to categorize their items.</li>
				<li>Project Shape (where selected products are stored for estimation)</li>
				<li>For each new product, we create additional separate list for it for proper estimating</li>
				<li>pattern_positions - a table associating pattern with products and used to get which products will be auto loaded for any pattern</li>
