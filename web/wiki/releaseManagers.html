				<p>Assigned by the team lead, they are one of our team members who are responsible in deoploying out our app release changes to the test lab and stores. They are also admins over seeing our repository such as SVN (old) or GIT (new). There are currently two release managers, they each alternate being release managers every month.</p>

				<h1>Issues with Git?</h1>
				<p>For example, If you need some features breanches deleted off in GIT, talk/email to the release manager of the current month as release managers alternate each month.
