		<h1>System V</h1>
		<p>A application located usually at the Menards stores, aka blue screen that allows team members to look up SKU items and locate items as well as perform special orders and many other store related functions.</p>
		
		<p>It also host a database where stores pull their product information from such as, SKU, prices, availability, etc. We also use System V's server to test and collect product data for our apps.</p>
		<section>
			<h1>Highlights</h1>
			<p>When testing our application during the final stage, we will connect our apps to System 5 for testing. This will give us a exact simulation of an actual Menards store.</p>

			<h1>To run System V here at the office</h1>
			<section>
				<p>In the lab, run system v off an enterprise machine. Say if you made esitmate on a 8888, to pull that order from system V, you want to use an 8888 enterprise machine to run system V. If you run system V on 8888 enterprise, you can only see orders made from 8888 store PCs and not orders from any other store such as 4444 or 5555. If you want to see orders from real store transactions, say from store 3011, you have to use system V on a machine at the store, not here in the lab. It is currently not possible to run system V on a PC here at the office to pull orders made at an actual store, to do that you would use the database instead rather than on System V.
