					MVC, MVP, MVVM, MV* ... etc there are no services. If there are, the term is used to refer to any generic object, which that can be injected into a controller or view model.
					</p>
					<p>
					MVC - the controller is injected with the model and view. Controller acts like the service, but not really. One controller for each model.
