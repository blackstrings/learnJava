		<h1>JUnit</h1>
		<p>A java third party tool that comes with <a class="link" href="eclipse.html">eclipse</a> (can be manually installed to other IDE) that we can use to test our java codes in whatever project we work in. We use JUnit for testing so that we can see, hit and ensure all lines in a particular function is working. We don't have to test getters and setters.</p>
		<p>It is a quick way to test our code without opening or running the application GUI itself. JUnit will run the test class and give instant feedbacks if a certain function failed or passes. The idea is, you write a test to test each function, and in the future after code changes to your app, you run the all the test and it will tell you if the new codes broke any of your old functionalities.
		</p>
		<section>
			<h1>Setup</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>To start writing Junits, you have to have a Junit MCR created for you first, the MCR is usually set to 40 hours</li>
				<li>Junits are good to work on during down times when most MCRs are done</li>
				<li>When you get an MCR for Junit, you will be focused on a specific application and also under a specific package</li>
				
				<li>To test your codes, you first have to study and understand the package and the app, and what you will be testing specifically under each package </li>
				<li>Use the @test anontation above each of your test functions</li>
				<li>Assert.assertTrue( test, answerWeAreLookingFor );</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Junit Issues</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
				Some junits will not run using Eclipse due to java 7 and powermock.
				you will see a stackframe error. This means you'll have to put this VM arugment variable in the run configuration for the test class you want to run.
				<img src="images/junit-1.png" width="100%"/>
				<br>
				Don't forget to click apply.
				The build version has this set in the pom so it will work during build. However to run it in the IDE, you have to use this method.

@Test
public void addFunctionTest(){
	//create the necessary steps to test

				<h1>What you want to avoid testing</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Methods inside methods</li>
					<li>codes with no logic (or codes that do not have if and then statements)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h1>Key purposes of JUnit</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>The sole purpose of writing a test method for the class that you are testing, is to make sure that you eventually call a class's method within the scope of the test method. Not calling a single class's method at all defeats the purpose of Junit</li>
					<li>JUnit testing doesn't care about private methods because it shouldn't need to, if you must however, use PowerMockito</li>
					<li>Perform unique individual code specific test or as it says, unit testing</li>
				</ul>
