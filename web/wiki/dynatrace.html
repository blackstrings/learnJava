		<p>
		A software we use for detecting SLA performance. When we get an EAM about SLA, the assigned person of the week who is to take care of the SLA EAM tickets, will drill down to dynatrace to help them debug where the SLA issue is occurring in what app. Dynatrace is one of the tools we use, but you can also use <a href="truesight.html">True Sight</a>.
		</p>
		
		<section>
			<h1>Installing Dynatrace</h1>
			<section>
				<p>Unlike true sight, To get access, you need to install it on your machine. Ask team lead or another team member who has used it before how to install and use it.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h1>Usage</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
				DynaTrace is really good at tracking down 500 errors. In the EAM ticket, there will be a quick note on whether it is 500 errors, huge files, or performance.
				Try using Dyna Trace to look for errors based on last week (Mon to Sat). Errors and Exceptions should help.

				<p>In this case, this 500 error eception doesn't show anything useful</p>
