			<p>A 3D framework all in <a href="javascript.html" class="link">javascript</a> initially proposed (2014) to be our next 3d engine framework, but Unity Engine (2015) will be become the 3d engine instead.</p>
			<section>
				<h1>Features</h1>
				<p class="column3">We currently only use threejs in the shelving application, 
				however, It was used to create prototypes until Unity came along :).
				FYI - ThreeJS was not built to be used in a AMD modules structure. so you can't use threejs in requirJS, 
				you'll have to call threeJS explicitly.
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<h1>ThreeJS Local Sandbox</h1>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Getting Started</h2>
				<p>download threejs.min.js from online source, there's only one file. If you download the whole package, you'll get examples,
				plus the loaders and good stuff. Then explicitly load the threejs script into your html. Visit the examples to see.</p>
			</section>
			
			<h1>Three js samples</h1>
			<section>
				<p>Note that Three JS does not allow loading external files on Chrome or IE, due to cross domain policy. Use firefox instead.
				If you procedurally create objects, then it'll work, but if you load obj files and texture, it wont load in Chrom or IE.

			<h1>Basics</h1>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Transparency</h2>
				<p>make sure the mtl has a d and map_d set. d should be set to .999. and Kd set to 1.0</p>
				<img src="images/threeTransparency1.png" class="fit popup">
				<p>One png file is enough to control color and transparency, no need for a 2nd png file to act as alpha channel</p>
