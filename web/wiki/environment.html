		<h1>Environment Pointing</h1>
		<p>All of our kiosk applications point to an environment when running the application. They point to environments so that they can get the correct data when loading product information (ie. type, size, length, name, etc) -- not pricing though, as pricing is pulled from a different data not related to environment pointing</p>
		
		<p>
		When testing or running the applications at our desk PC, we try not to run the kiosks under production (prod) environment -- just something the business team prefer us not to do. So instead we point to staging environment. From time to time, you'll see that you may have to change the environment for some applications when running certain test in the lab or at your computer. Recently our developer created a <a href="evnsetter.html" class="link">EvnSetter</a> tool which lets use change the config without opening any files.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Take note that depending on what the application it is (ie. Java, C++, webapp) there is a different method on how to go about changing the environment for each.

			<p><span style="color:red">7801 use qa.main.store for MCR testing</span> </p>
			<p><span style="color:red">7901 use prod.preview.store for regression testing</span></p>
			<p>If you change the environment, make sure to change them back</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C:/ > Menards > env > DesignItConfig > designItEnv.properties</li>
				</li>
				<li>Modify the file to env= (change to one of the below environment selection) > save > run the app</li>
				<li>Possible Environments we can point to</li>
				<li>The new stage we should be using in dev or staging is 
				<span class="customBorder">
				ua-designit.preview.campus
				</span></li>
				<li>we should not use or avoid prod environment for regular dev testing, but prod is <span class="customBorder">prod.main.store</span></li>
				<li>These env below are the old ones
				<li>stage.main.internal.store</li>
				<li>stage.staging.internal.store</li>
				
				<li>stage.staging.external.client<br>
				#this one is for stage prev<br>
				# Use it when an app like Deck, needs to read StagePreview-Design-it-Tables mySQL data that you've made change in</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When bare metaling, set the default to stage.ua-designit.store on 8888 and 4444 and store override service id to 3011</p>

			<h1>Web Applications</h1>
			<section>
			<ul>
				<li>For roofing, siding and gutter, you have to point the URL/environment to the stage environment when <a href="labtesting.html">lab testing</a>
					<ul>
						<li>On 8888 test store, F6 > pass > MyComputer > C > Menards > Utils > MenardAppMenu > dsgnit.xml</li>
						<li>Right click on dsgnit.xml and open in notepad</li>
						<li>scroll to the bottom set of tags, one is for gutter, roofing, and siding, set all three to the following</li>
						<li>AppArg should = stage-kiosk...=restart&amp;selection(storeNumber)=3011"...</li>

			<h1>C++</h1>
			<section>
			<p>As of Dec 2015, C++ apps now use the reaf environments, before the CApps didn't use the reaf environments</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Because all the product data are located inside the ini files within the app root folder, so there is no need to point to environments for C apps</li>
				<li>However, every app does point to a store regardless of why type of app it is</li>
				<li>C:/ > menards > utils > host.ini & store.ini </li>
				<li>4444 is our test store which usually is correct, but you can point to 3011 (store east) if certain products aren't showing up</li>
				<li>Other times when ask to point to staging with C apps, it may just mean to get or test the staging branch from the repository using SVN. In other words, just checkout (svn) the staging branch as you would with any other C app for testing.</li>
