		<h1>Deck</h1>

			<h1>Hint</h1>
			<section>
			<ul>
				<li>If you need to modify or change something on the java app, ask yourself if this is a change on a certain screen, if so start by looking for the correct XML screen, from there it may be the center source to get to all other functions and screens</li>

			<h1>Additional Screens and ScreenFlow Info</h1>
			<section>
			<p>When running an app in debug mode, the blue highlighted xml are the inner panels called in that particular main screen. Use those to locate the panels to make modifications.</p>
			<h2>*screen.XML</h2>
			<ul>
				<h2>&lt;init&gt;</h2>
				<li>init - show/hide grab spots - controls what selections can be made</li>
				<li>determine if current screen has to be skipped</li>
				<li>set local XML variable		s used for screen</li>
				<li>load vital info for screen</li>
				
				<h2>&lt;text&gt;</h2>
				<li>Location - position on screen/panel</li>
				<li>Size - text box size max length limit before new line starts</li>
				<li>Align = similar to word doc alignment</li>
				<li>Font = Reaf settings for font sizes/colors, only fonts specified in fonts.LUA</li>
				<li>Message = what the text say</li>
				
				<h2>&lt;display&gt;</h2>
				<li>used to include script before making the message, to input dynamic text</li>
				<li>can also hide/show certain images</li>
				<li>convert variables that are not strings into proper readable variables</li>
				<li><img src="images/screenFlowXML.jpg"/></li>
				
				<h2>&lt;fixedPanel&gt;</h2>
				<li>Each fixedPanel has its own ideology and functions</li>
				
				<h2>&lt;autoPanel&gt;</h2>
				<li>Most of the product selections use autoPanel because they get their information from databases. To add or remove buttons, we simply change the database and the button will be removed or added.</li>
				<li>Can set columns and rows, and next and prev buttons will appear only if the number of items loaded exceed the col and rows.
				
				<h2>&lt;image&gt;</h2>

			<h1>Save and Recall</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
				We can save designs and recall them in deck. One tricky thing about recall is that if you are in prod environment, and you save, you have to change the environment to stage and then recall the design. If you are in stage, and save, you shouldn't have to change the environment and should be able to recall the design while still under the same stage environmnet.
