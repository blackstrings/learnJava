		<p>Findbugs is a tool under jenkins. When jenkin builds the app, findbug will run along side with the build and gather data.</p>
		<section>
			<h1>Highlights</h1>
			<p>The find bug tab will allow you to see per app what  issues were found if any. After each build, if any issue is found, a ticket can be created to fix these issues.</p>
			
		</section>
	
		<section>
			<h1>Fixing Issues</h1>
			<p>
			If the fix is in a develop branch: Once the issue is fixed pushed to stash, find bugs will run again on the new build and let you know when complete, if the issue is still there or not.
			</p>
			<p>
			If the issue is in a feature branch: Get help you don't know how to push your feature branch to jenkins to build. You can get jenkins to build specific branches if needed. After the build, check findbugs if the issue is still there.
