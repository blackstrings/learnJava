		<h1>GIT</h1>
		<p>
		Programmers working together need a way to work on same files. Sub Version Control (SVC) is a method that allows programmers to do this. GIT is basically a SVC tool. In short it allows a programmer to checkout a file, modify it, and commit the file back to the repository. As of November 2014, GIT replaces the old Tortoise SVN we used to use for file versioning. One of the unique features of GIT is being able to checkout, create, and merge branches all through a simple git command line.

				<ul>
					<li>Master or Tag are created into a develop branch at the very initial state of the project</h1>
					<li>feature branches created off of develop branch</h1>
					<li>features branches completed are merged into develop, never master</1i>
					<li>once develop acquires enough features, fork a release branch off of develop, and no new features can be added at this point</li>
					<li>once release candidate is ready to ship, tag release and merge release into master and develop</li>
					<li>only hotfix or maintenance branches can branch off of master, and when complete, merged into master and develop (or current RC) and tagged with updated version number</li>

			<p>
				Note that for windows, there is GIT for windows and GIT itself. If you install GITHub for windows, it'll come with both GIT and the gui.
				anycase, there are multiple ways to install GIT. Only after installing, are you able to use git commands.

			<h1>Conflicts with checkingout a new branch</h1>
			<p>
			When you have an old develop branch and other feature branches and you pull in a new branch that is branched off a new developed branch. You will come across this issue. To fix, use the explore window to move the conflicting file out of the workspace directory, checkout the project in eclipse, then put the conflicting file back. You should only have to do this once every time the developer branch is updated.
