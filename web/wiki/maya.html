			<h1>UI Changes</h1>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Docking Windows</h2>
				<p>
				Click drag a window to move and arrage. If you pop out a window, double click the tab to redock the window.
				The channel box, attribute editor(Ctrl+A) now have icons on the top right screen to show them.
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Nucleus</h1>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Understand Basic</h2>
				<p>
				You usually have one nucleus, but you can have multiple. One nucleus will be linked to multple objects in the scene using dynamics, such as a flag,
				 cloth, etc. Nucleus controls all the basic gravity, window, turbulence etc for all objects in the scene.
				</p>
				<p>
				Nucleus has it's own ground plane if you wish to use it, just turn it on in this attribute editor.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Wind</h2>
				<p>
				Just increase the wind speed and direction to start affecting nucleus objects.
				</p>
				<img src="images/mayaNucleus2.png" class="fit popup"/>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Interactive Playback</h2>
				<p>
				Allows you to adjust wind speed stuff in real time while playing. Make sure to have enough time in timeline. Sovler > interactive playback.
				</p>
				<img src="images/mayaNucleus2.png" class="fit popup"/>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Fine Turning Solver</h2>
				<p>
				Nucleus node > solver attribute > sbutsteps or max collision iterations increase if you have problems with say a flag folder in the wind.
				You'll have to fine tune for each scene. Downside is that playback will become slower. When it becomes too slow, make a playblast video instead to see the animation.
				playblast will be common.
				</p>

		<section>
			<h1>nCloth</h1>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Understand Scale</h2>
				<p>Maya simulations assumes you build your object as 1/100 scale. not 1:1 scale as the size may be too big to build a city.
				If you do build it at 1:1 scale (only good for small objects), you'll have to up the scale attribute in nucleus to simulate the correct gravity.
				Select Nucleus obj in scene > scale attributes > change 1.0 to .01</p>
				<img src="images/mayaNucleus1.png" class="fit popup"/>

				<p>
				Or you can change the gravity(not recommended), move decimal two places to the right to get a bigger gravity.
				</p>

				<p>
				Start scene by changing grid size > Display > Grid > up the grid scale so it's bigger to model in.
				</p>
				<img src="images/mayaGrid1.png" class="fit popup"/>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Create nCloth</h2>
				<p>
				nCloth only works with polygons. Give cloth square polygons subdivision as much as possible. Freeze transform plane after cloth creation. Scale should b 1,1,1. 
				create a copy before turning plane into nCloth. Once you nCloth an obj, it's hard to revert it back so make copy of it. select a plane > make it ncloth.
				</p>
				<p>
				Change nucleus scale size if needed depending if you built obj 1:1 ratio or not.
				When you play simulation, if your object is moving too slow, then the object is too big.
				</p>
				<p>
				Change time setting to player every 24 frames or everyframe. Which ever one that will solve when you hit play.
				It shoudl be play every frame, but if every frame is not working, reset your entire maya preferences.

				Set your timeline to 100. Click play.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Ncloth Presets</h2>
				<p>Maya ships with a lot of presets for you to simulate different cloths. Use the presets on the nClothShape node and click hold on presets > replace.
				Start with presets, then tweak to your liking.
				</p>
				<img src="images/mayaNcloth1.png" class="fit popup"/>
				<p>
				Best preset for table cloth is burlap, then tweak the passive object's friction to 1.0. ClothShape node friction to 4 and stickiness to 1.0 or higher.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Constraints</h2>
				<p>Make object nCloth > select vertices > nConstraints > trannsform > apply. A locator will be created for you. Play simulation.
				When selecting multiple vertex, after creating constraint, you may want to move the constarint locator to another corner or place where the snap should be most solid at.
				</p>
				<p>
				To add more vertext to a pre-existing constraint. Select constraint > shft select cloth > vertex > select more vertex > nConstraints > add member
				</p>
				<p>
				Drop off in constaints helps smooth the strength of constraints at the locator. Modify these values under the constaintNode
				</p>
				<img src="images/mayaNconstraint1.png" class="fit popup"/>
				<p>To constraint ncloth to n√ßloth, you want to select vertices on both nCloth objects, and select component to component. You won't get a locator for this type of constraint</p>
			</section>

			<section class="box">
				<h2>Bake Simulation no Cache</h2>
				<p>Baking simulation xyz rotation, scale, and translation.
				Edit > set key > bake simulation. select the channels you want to key.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="box">
				<h2>Bake Simulation with cache</h2>
				<p>For cloth that deform dynamically, you want to cache it instead of bake. 
				Set your time line to how far you want to cache. then Cache. Once cache, to change simulation like wind speed, you must delete the cache.
				</p>
				<p>Click cloth object, nCache > create cache.
				Caching will start. After cache, you can scroll the timeline at will and get same result. Then you can proceed to render.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="box">
				<h2>Cloth intersection fix</h2>
				<p>Make sure the cloth thickness is high, under the clothShape node.
				</p>
				<img src="images/mayaNcloth2.png" class="fit popup"/>
				<p>Turn on collision thickness envelope display view to see better of the thickness</p>
				<img src="images/mayaNcloth3.png" class="fit popup"/>
			</section>

			<section class="box">
				<h2>Render Prep</h2>
				<p>The cloth can be smoothed a couple of ways. Method 1 and cheap way is pressing 3 then use mental ray to render. the 3 smooth key will not work
				for other renders other than mental ray. CACHE the simulation before you render it!!!</p>
				<p>
				For old school method and to use software or hardward, you have to use the mesh > smooth under polygons. Select cloth > apply mesh smooth > then
				under the smooth node on the mesh > Make sure to turn off keep border to have smoother edges.
				</p>
				<img src="images/mayaNcloth5.png" class="fit popup"/>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>set Initial State</h2>
				<p>Instead of starting from a square shape cloth to solve, you can simulate and start from a different cloth shape after it has been deform.
				Select cloth > nSolver > set from current. Rewind timeline and the shape should start from that initial state. If you want another state, go to that timeline,
				and set from current again.
				</p>
				<p>To clear initial state and go back > nSolver > clear inital state</p>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Multiple NCloth</h2>
				<p>For optimization, disable ncloth that are not needed when simulating other ncloths. Select ncloth object > uncheck enable in the nClothShape node.</p>
				<p>You can create a rope using nCloth. Transform constraint one or two end of rope. Use t-shirt preset, and change stretch resistance to 1000.</p>
