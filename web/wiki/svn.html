		<h1>TotoiseSVN</h1>
		<p>
		When you get your PC, the application should already come installed with TortoiseSVN. If not talk to your mentor or teamlead.
		</p>
		
		<p>SVN is a tool which allows multiple users to manage version-ing files by checking out and checking in files from the repository (a storage server). In other words, the same file with changes made by one person can be downloaded and viewed by another person to then be further edited and put back into the repository.</p>
		
		<p>When you open ToitiseSVN, you will notice a lot of folders. You will also soon realize that multiple Menards departments share the same repository where they also put their own folders here that's not related to your team</p>
		
		<section>
			<h1>Setup</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
				To use and start checking out files, Right click inside an opened folder window > SVN Checkout > URL of repository
				</li>
				<li>You can use either one below to start your first test</li>
				<li>svn://omdc-source/ISS/Cross-Team/</li>
				<li>or</li>
				<li>svn://omdc-source/ISS/Kiosk/</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Two Major Folders in the Repository We Care About</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
				<strong>CrossTeam</strong> - utils tools shared by other departments
				</li>

				<li>
				<strong>Kiosk</strong> - everything relating to our applications, even if the kiosk isn't on our team.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Terminology</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
				URL of repository - The location of the repository that you want to check out.<br/><br/>
				</li>
				<li>
				Checkout directory - where you want the files from the repository to go on your local machine.<br/><br/>
				</li>
				<li>
				Checkout Depth - How much of the structure you want to check out.  You can check out a single item but we always just use Fully Recursive.<br/><br/>
				</li>
				<li>
				Revision - Each change a person commits gives the structure a new revision number.  Head revision means the latest and greatest, but you can select the Revision button to choose what change specifically you want to check out.<br/><br/>
				</li>
				<li>
				Clicking OK will give you the folder and files and place them where the checkout directory is specified.<br/><br/>
				</li>
				<li>
				Checkout - checkout a file<br/><br/>
				</li>
				<li>
				Commit - put the file back on the repository
				</li>
