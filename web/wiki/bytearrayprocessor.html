				<h1>Byte Array Processor (BAP) </h1>
				<section>
					<p>An in-house online web tool (link can be retrieved from team lead) we use to mannually convert saved design (blob format) from one version to another version. We do this to convert designs that would otherwise not be compatible with new app changes.</p>
					<p>
					Say Deck version v2.0 saves a design as DESA. Later down the road, Deck gets a new version update to v3.0 which has a lot of things added on. The old DESA may no longer be compatible as a recall in Deck v3.0. Therefore, the BPA becomes handy and we use it to convert old saved designs to be upgraded so that it can be recalled and compatible in the newer Deck v3.0.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					We usually wait till after midnight and we do a huge batch conversion of all saved designs. This BAP can be used for other app conversion as well, such as flooring, landscaping etc. Not all apps may be compatiable with this byte array processor until implemented.
