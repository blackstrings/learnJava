			<p>Part of lab testing when testing MCRs. Basically we create an estimate and save it under the application we are testing. We then do a printout which will have the design id and estimate id and price. We email a specific person who has access to myMenards and can lookup using EFU to see of the results matched our design estimate.</p>
