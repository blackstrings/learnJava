			<h1>Testing Webstart</h1>
			<section>
				<p>Merica will give you links to test webstart MCRs. You test it at your local PC as it can only work here. Always have the java console open and handy when running these.</p>
				
				<p>
				<figCaption>java console</figCaption>

				After you enable the java console, when you run a webstart app, the console will auto open for you. If you run into any issues, look at the java console logs</p>
				
				<ul>
					<dl>Before running the JNLP download link, do the following if you are testing against stage (note this is different from preview or dub dub)</dl>
					<li>browser > stage.menards.com</li>
					<li>Login using your user and pass</li>
					<li>Point to a store with your login account and make it your store</li>
					<li>You can now run the JNLP and it should pick up your store on stage</li>

			<h1>External PC Testing</h1>
			<section>
				<p>We test the webstart apps like Deck, Landscaping, and Flooring. We use the main www.menards.com link so we are testing the actual site. After the apps pass on both OS win7 and win8, we want to install/update the java JRE to the latest update and test all the apps again on both OS. We log our time and comments under ticket 164829.
