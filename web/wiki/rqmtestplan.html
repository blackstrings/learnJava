		<h1>RQM Test Plan</h1>
		<p>We create test plan before we can run the MCR tests in the lab -- for example for Q3R1 August Test Plan. Every month when we complete our MCRs, testing comes, and that testing has a name -- for example Test Plan Q3R1, Test Plan Q3R2, etc. The name changes every month and increments throughout the year and resets the following new year to Q1R1.

				<li>RQM (2 windows, one for searching the tests and one for putting the tests)</li>
				<li>Redmine > filter by clicking on the correct Q3R1 Month under the custom query

				</li>
				<li><img src="images/rqmtestplan2.png" width="100%" /></li>
				<li>Basically you want to put all the MCR tests into the new test plan you created, you just have to be careful with one is a test suite and which is a test case</li>
				<li>Put MCR test suites in suites and MCR test cases in case within the test plan.</li>
				<li>The rest of the instruction is similar to how you create test suite, case, scripts, where you put scripts inside case, and case inside suites</li>
			</ul>
