If you are in stage, you can save your deck and recall your deck under stage. Make sure your designit config gim is set to stage. Do this by opening C:\menards\env\config\gim.properties. Ensure the gim-d and switch to gim-s from the picture here <br><img src="images/saveandrecall1.png">

			<p>You should be able to save and recall regardless of what environment, unlike deck.</p>
