		<p>If you made an error or mistake on a MCR ticket and the business wants something change while they were testing an RC.
		The ticket should be passed back to team lead, and he/she will pass the ticket to you.
		You create a bug fix branch off the Release branch, not the RC branches, pull that bugfix branch in, and make changes and push it back to stash, then get it code reviewed and back to merica for final gui review.</p>
