				<p>Overview process of converting a hi-res model to a lower res</p>

				<h2>Materials</h2>
				<p>Not all obj have a image jpeg or png texture file. Objs that are solid throughout, will usually not have a image texture and instead,
				utilize the obj diffuse RBG to get its color. High poly count objects like baskets will utilize a transparent texture image 
				to fake the details. Every object however should have a obj and mtl at bare minimum for shelving to work with.</p>

			<section class="box">
				<h2>Transparency MTL for ThreeJS webGL</h2>
				<p>d 0.9999 - has to be this for threejs, don't do 1.0(no transprancy) or 0.0(100% transparency)
				although any value other than 0 will be opaque in blender, but is fine, just enable transparency when bringing it into blender.</p>
				<p>Kd 1.0 1.0 1.0 - you want for blender & threejs, (0 makes color very black in threejs, and opaque in blender)
				The close the value is to zero, the darker material gets in threejs.
				</p>
				<p>Ni - dont matter, can be 1 or 0</p>
				<p>illum 1 - should not be 3 or 4 for both blender and threejs(get black transparency)
				<img src="images/shelvingMTL1.png" class="fit popup">
				<p>After long testing, these are the final settings that matter for threeJS and should be this way for all transparency</p>

			<h1>Accessing the data server</h1>
			<section class="box">
				<p>Use WinSCP</p>
				<table width="100%">
					<tr>
						<td>Preview read only</td>
						<td><img src="images/shelvingData1.png" class="fit popup"></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Path to Media/Obj</h2>
				<p>Once you login using winscp, the path to the vendors is <span style="color:red">/var/www/nas-eklka/prev/items/media</a></p>
				<p>To access the vendor product, append the vendor name. this folder has all the vendors for all apps. So you want to narrow
				 your search by going to specific vendors and then under Visualization</p>
				<p>/var/www/nas-eklka/prev/items/media/RUBBE002/Visualization</p>

			<h1>Running the App</h1>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Testing Shelving Locally</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Make sure pointing to menards.net</li>
					<li>Make sure data is not null, hard code the path</li>
					<li>Make sure the canvas is bigger than the shelf we are adding</li>
					<li>Transparency should work and alpha channel should work without moding the data.</li>
					<li>One png file can act as the kd and d for transparency and carry any color. You don't need two files.</li>
					<li>For double side to work, must turn on double on material in the child traverse</li>
