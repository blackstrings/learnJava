				<h2>Transparency MTL for ThreeJS webGL</h2>
				<p>d 0.9999 - has to be this for threejs, don't do 1.0(no transprancy) or 0.0(100% transparency)
				although any value other than 0 will be opaque in blender, but is fine, just enable transparency when bringing it into blender.</p>
				<p>Kd 1.0 1.0 1.0 - you want for blender & threejs, (0 makes color very black in threejs, and opaque in blender)
				The close the value is to zero, the darker material gets in threejs.
				</p>
				<p>Ni - dont matter, can be 1 or 0</p>
				<p>illum 1 - should not be 3 or 4 for both blender and threejs(get black transparency)
				<img src="images/shelvingMTL1.png" class="fit popup">
				<p>After long testing, these are the final settings that matter for threeJS and should be this way for all transparency</p>

				<h2>Testing Shelving Locally</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Make sure pointing to menards.net</li>
					<li>Make sure data is not null, hard code the path</li>
					<li>Make sure the canvas is bigger than the shelf we are adding</li>
					<li>Transparency should work and alpha channel should work without moding the data.</li>
					<li>One png file can act as the kd and d for transparency and carry any color. You don't need two files.</li>
					<li>For double side to work, must turn on double on material in the child traverse</li>
