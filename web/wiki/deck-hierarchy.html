		<h1>Deck Hierarchy</h1>
		<p>To fix codes and perform Junits, you need to understand the hierarchy of how Deck is pieced together and how it is build and how parts work with each other.

			<h1>Hierarchy</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>ProductDTO is used to hold a lot of data for a deck level</li>
				<li>Profiles are used to also hold data like beam, joist, etc, so the deckmodel knows what to call and look for inside the deckmodelDTO</li>
				</li>
				<li>In a simple concept, if you want to know how many beams there are in a deck level, you should be able to get that by creating a level and passing that level into the EstBeam class, and the EstBeam class should be able to calculate the amount of beams for that level</li>
