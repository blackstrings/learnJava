		<h1>Code Collaborator (CC)</h1>
		<p><span style="color:yellow; font-size:14px">Though we are no longer using Code Collaborator</span>, it has been replaced with <a href="codereview.html" class="link">Fisheye + Crucible</a>, code collaborator is a third-party online site we use for sharing our source codes that we have modified, changed, deleted, or added.  Once uploaded to CC, other team members are then assigned to review and observe the code changes. This is done so that codes can be properly checked for accuracy before they get merged/incorporated into the latest app version.</p>
		
		<section>
			<h1>Highlights</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>You'll need a login to access CC</li>
				<li><a href="http://codereview.menards.net/" target="_blank">
				http://codereview.menards.net/
				</a>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				We create a code review for each MCR ticket in CC and assign them to the primary and secondary to review to approve and then the rest of the team members are observer. We always add Merica (team lead) as an observer.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h1>Process</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>After Redmine construction phase, which is after you have went on to make the code changes on a branch and have SVN commit the branch back to the feature repository folder, you want to create a code review in CC for the codes you have changed.
				</li>
				<li>
				During creating a code review, you will attach the feature branch and CC will somehow upload the correct branch from SVN to CC for you.
				</li>
				<li>
				Assign the primary and secondary and an observer.
				</li>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<section>
			<h1>Creating a Review</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>After you commit your feature branch to the Repo using tortoiseSVN</li>
				<li>CC browser > create new review > Title: same as MCR > Overview: summary of what you did > Set Author, Reviewers, Observers</li>
				<li>Attach Checked-in Changelist

			<h1>Fix revision after defect is found</h1>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Go and fix the code where TM founded defects. </li>
				<li>In window explorer, highlight and SVN commit the feature branch back into the repo</li>
				<li>Go to CC browser > Click on your review > Edit > scroll down > click attach checked-in changelist</li>
				<li>show log on feature branch in SVN repo to get the log window below on right</li>
				<li>Only put (one) the latest revision number into the changelist > continue</li>
				<li><img width="80%" src="images/cc-1.png"></li>
				<li>Note that CC cares only about the revision number and is how CC tracks for commit changes</li>
