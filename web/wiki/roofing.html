				<li>For each environment dev, stage, prod, and for each app server, you will need to add an exception list for them</li>
				<li>ex: visit any stage link for roofing, you will see that the url is something like "http://kiosk-stage1-app-kvm:8080"</li>
				<li>Add that url, with or without the :8080 to your java exception list</li>
				
				<h2>environment check</h2>
				<li>If roofing/siding doesn't work, check sidingEstimator.log or roofingEstimator.log to see if appConfig is found or not</li>
				<li>environment.properties is where the appConfig path is set</li>
				<li>Note:environment.properties is still not stable appConfig missing error may occur in log when starting roofing</li>
				<li>most likly you'll need to append an absolute path appConfig=c:/app/tcserver/designit/opt/Kiosk/Properties/RoofingEstimator/appConfig.properties</li>
				<li>make sure then in tcserver, you have the correct folders created leading to where appConfig.properties should be in, which you can find in roofing branch</li>
				
				<h2>enterprise mode check</h2>

				<p>
				Our web apps like roofing and siding also utilize using multiple environments.
				So that for dev we would load properties for dev only, same goes for stage and prod.
				Siding and roofing tend to have this wierd location where it put its appConfig.properties file.

				If the appConfig.properties isn't found, the RoofingEstimator.log will log this error (although the app may not crash) 
				it can get annoying.
				to fix this, you don't have to touch the properties file location nor the statsLogging.java. Just create these folders
				under your root C:Drive opt/Kiosk/RoofingEstimator/ and put the appConfig.properties here.

				<h1>Fasteners</h1>
				<p>
				The way how fastener are estimated in roofing is this. During Estimate, it will gather the needed fastener into a temporary hashtable called holdCalculation. Utility is called at the end of each estimate to pass the holdCalculation hashtable to another thread like so for the later final estimation. When FinalMaterial.java is called, each Fasterner.java, FastenerCap.java is called to use those values inside the hold calculations. Each fastener class is what determines the type of fastener sku to use. It is then put inside the preMatList like how other products are added.

			<h1>Debugging Roofing Warmup Practice</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
				Before you start debugging Roofing there are some things you'll need to understand.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You'll need apache installed</li>
					<li>You need to have java 1.7, or check if Roofing requires 1.8+</li>
					<li>Know how to build Roofing and deploy to local Jboss or TomCat Server
						<ul>
							<li>If not, you'll need to learn how to deploy to server, stop/start server</li>
							<li>Like any java appilcation Server(JBoss-WildFly, TomCat, GlassFish), it needs to be running for you to debug locally on your PC</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>How to know what JSP, Java Controller, Display Controller files is called on which page
						<ul>
							<li>Short answer: view tiles-def.xml</li>
							<li>run app > go to a page you want > F12</li>
							<li>see source and there is a little commented line telling you want JSP</li>
							<li>Search in eclipse the jsp name without jsp</li>
							<li>You must search under .jsp and .xml</li>
							<li>The most important to understand is that the ScreenXXXX.java and layout.jsp are mapped in a file called tiles-defs.xml</li>
							<li>tiles-def.xml controlls what screens have which jsp loaded and what products to show on screen</li>
							<li><a href="images/roofingHint2.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/roofingHint2.png" width="30%" style="border:thin solid #000"/></a>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Know that JSP layout files are the ones that create the pages you see on the screen, they become the html or php file</li>
					<li>Java controller files ScreenXXXX.java are the ones that call/handles what JSP files to call</li>
					<li>The same JSP layout file may be used by multiple screenXXXX.java so take note on that (i.e. rowColumnLayout.jsp is used by a few screens)</li>
					<li>Images are located under src/main/resources/web/media/images & all images are stored here<li>
					<li>JSP uses JSTL and EL langauages c:if, c:set, logic, etc, to work with java objects.</li>
					<li>For a java object to be usable, a bean is used to grab the java object, visi <a href="jstl.html">JSTL</a> for more info</li>

			<h1>Code Change Not in Deployment, Cache Issue, Testing Issue</h1>
			<section>
				<p>If your code didn't get changed on stage after deployment, make sure you clear the cache. Open roofing in the browser, 
				hit ctrl + F5 to clear the browser cache. This could be due to why, the tester failed to run your code, the lab pc also needs,
				to be refreshed in its cache if the PC has not been rebooted.</p>

			<h1>Debugging Javascript in JSP</h1>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>F12</h2>
				<p>Any browser will usually work in debugging js. Just press f12. You will only see js files that are loaded in the currrent page,
				so make sure you are on the correct page to target the js file you want to test.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section class="box">
				<h2>F12</h2>
				<p>In IE11, look for paging.js, breakpoint there as it seems to play responsibility in modifying item links onto a tag element</p>

			<h1>Items Not Loading/showing Debugging - products not showing</h1>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Basic Check</h2>
				<p> First test stage kioskURL to see if stage is down. </p>
				<p>2nd check the logs on tcserver designit instance</p>
			</section>
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Other Check</h2>
				<p>If app is working stage isn't down. next try looking into ItemDisplayController. Everyscreen seems to use the class ItemDisplayController 
				to make the calls to SQL connections.
				and loads them into a ItemObjects to be ready for jsp to use to display it on screen.
				</p>
				<p>
				Check your TCServer designit instance if it has the following <a href="tcserver.html#installation2" target="_blank" />JARS</a></p>
				<p>
				If it is your first time setting up Tcserver or roofing on your PC, also <a href="tcserver.html#installation2" target="_blank" /> view checklist </a>
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section class="box">
				<h2>onload vs jquery</h2>
				<p>
				It could be that the screenXXXX.do page onload event never was able to call the initPage() method, (method located in paging.js).
				The initPage() handles appending the item's image path to the document. So go to browser debugger, load up the page, and find and break point at initPage().
				If the initPage() or start() onload isn't being properly loaded, one solution is to refactor it into a jquery on document ready.
				This was bug when running roofing/siding locally on tcserver and running in IE8 enterprise mode.

			<h1>How to know which screen to go to when updating a java/jsp file.</h1>
			
			<section>
			<p>Run the app in browser > press f12 > at top of html is a hint of what jsp page is running the current page</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
			<p>Use the url name. When you go to a new page, in the url you will see something like /screen2002.do. That is the screen name of the previous page (it's not the name of the current page you are viewing, wierd but that's the way it is).  Visit the tiles-def.xml file > search for that screen name > each screen is mapped to a jsp file, and that's how you know what jsp runs that screen. You can further look inside that jsp if it has any other dependents.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
			<p>Need to look up what jsp calls in what image: Look up the image by its prefix doing a file search in eclipse</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ex: S979166_XX.image=web/media/images/optionalMaterials/chimneyFlashingKit/selections/S450600_XX.jpg</li>

				<li>Then you'll get a search result like this below:<br>
				<img src="images/roofingHint1.png" width="90%"></li>
				<li>Now you have to know that Pro-Snap is a roofing material and it is steel. When going through the app, you'll want to select steel</li>
				<li>If you do not know the materials enough, you'll have to ask a primary to help you faster to locate that screen untill you get used to the materials and where they are in the app</li>

			<h1>Updating screen flow - Understand the Strut Tile design pattern</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
				Unfortunately it's not a one switch type of deal to modify screen flow changes in roofing. First you want to start with the structs-config.xml. If you modify the structs file, and make screenA able to jump to screenC, you should also modify screenC to enable it to jump back to screenA. It's tedious but a must do.
				</p>
				<p>
				<strong>structs-config.xml</strong><br>
				Holds all the possible screens that can link between each other going forward and backward.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<strong>tiles-def.xml</strong><br>
				holds data on what (possible) items should be displayed on a specific screen. 
				Also is a list of all the possible screens in roofing. The first line under each screen tells you want controller 
				it is using and what jsp that screen is using.
				</p>
				<p>
				tiles-def.xml screen defines the layout.JSP page to use on what screen and what java controller to use. The layout.jsp uses handles displaying items on the screen. It uses JSTL and sometimes
				javascript to layout the items. layout.jsp may call/include a javascript to sort the items on the page. To know what javascript the JSP
				layout uses, check the .jsp file near top to see if an include was added or not. Sometimes, javascript is used to target the elemtent by
				id and then assign the image from the js file rather than use JSTL to assign the image src.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<strong>screenXXXXAction.java</strong><br>
				The class that has the two forward and back method on what screen to jump to. Controlls what screen can or should jump to according to what's selected.

			<h1>Deploying Roofing (same applies to any web apps)</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
					The web apps like roofing and sidings are deployed differently than the regular standalone apps that goes through altiris and gets released store by store. When the web apps gets released (as they are just a website) the apps is release nation wide to all stores.  The web apps have two types of deployment -- rolling deployement and nightly deployment.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a web app like Roofing is ready to get deploy at the end of every release cycle, we determine if roofing can be a rolling deployment or nightly deployment. The simple rule of thumb is, if there is no media involved or screen changes or new additions, and just some code changes, then it qualifies for rolling deployment.
				</p>
				<p>
					The benefit of rolling deployment is that we can deploy it during the day while we are at work. The only downside is that since we have to deploy the roofing App1 and App2 server both, it has to be done under a time limit, usually we have a 30 minute time frame limit for deploying App1.
				</p>
				<p>
					What happens is that during the deployment at the indicated time on this site you'll need to go to, the server will auto shut down App 1, and then at 30 minutes later, it will shut down App 2.  What we need to do is, as soon as App1 is shut down, we need to start it back up (through command line), run our test quickly with the web app open to see that our changes are on it, and then reactive the App1 server on the site, so customers can get back on app1 server again.  We must do this before App2 server starts its shutdown or else App1 will be shut off and as well as App2 be be shut off, so no one can use Roofing for the time being. Keep in mind we are deploying this live, so one server always has to be up. Once App1 is down and back up and active, app2 can have as much time it needs to do its testing if need be -- because everyone can be using App1 server while App2 is down. So app2 doesn't really have a time frame, just don't keep it off so long.

			<h1>Junit in roofing</h1>
			<section>
				<p>If junit test don't run out of the box, and gives you a missing class TestCreatePreliminaryEst.java, try maven update it should fix the problem
				and you should be able to run the test cases</p>
				<p>
				When introducting new propertie files or altering properties files, make sure you also copy the file and paste it under the test folder as the Junit test will run off the test properties files.
				</p>
				<p>
				Junit in roofing is possible but it has a unique setup and you must use it. For gutter Junit, you want to use TestGutterEst.java. 
				This class calls in  a external file such as (GutterEst1.txt ... gutterEst7.txt). Each text specifies the selections made in Roofing Gutter. 
				These weren't manually type, they are copied from the selectionsHashTable that can be viewed if you set a break point inside 
				CreatePreliminaryEst.java or better yet, in Estimate under startEstimate() towards the end of the method. Highlight all the 
				hash values under selectionsHashTable in the variables window and paste it in the text file to create your custom estimate. 
				You can then debug the test case to show you what exact values are being put into the material list.
				</p>
				<p>
				Hint: Put a break point in CreatePreliminaryEst.doCreatePreliminaryEst() at finalMaterials = null. 
				To get the final material list values before it gets rounded off under the prelinimaryMatList hashtable.
				Hint2: Put a break point in Estimate.startEstimate at return this.finalMaterialList to get final selectionsHashTable to use for Junit.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To get the list of selected values to paste onto a testCreate.txt for junit, hover over SelectionsHashTable variable in one of the classes above during
				a break point.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Shortcut to quickly generate asserts for selections, look to testCreatePreliminaryEst.java. 
				Call the method helpGenerateAsserts(hastable<>) within a setup test method to generete asserts in the console 
				for you to copy and paste it back into the test case.

			<h1>Generating material list for RQM</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
				You want to look at the estimteSummary.java. 
				turn on the logMaterialiForDev method and put a break point after this method call. 
				Run the app and it will log the materials you see on screen into a hashtable variable 
				for you to copy and paste into RQM.

			<h1>The Estimation Process</h1>
			<section>
				<img src="images/roofing_est1.png" width="100%">
				<p>
				The process is very different from Deck and Landscaping. 
				The SelectionsForm stores user selections into a map at runtime. When it is time to estimate, 
				towards the end of the program, The Estimate class will run. It will create another object call 
				CreatePreliminaryEst (CPE). Inside CPE, it will call objects and their estimation individually. 
				FinalMaterials is used when all the roofs are ready to be calculated, things like steel shingle options are calculated here.

			<h1>Flashing</h1>
			<section>
				<p>Flashing is a technique and also a long material (usually galvanize, that can be cut into smaller parts). It is used to seal where edges meet on a roof to prevent leak from rain. To calculate flashing material is as simple as finding the perimeter of the edges. The total perimeter length(x2) + width(x2) is how much flashing material you need to cover that length if the shape is a sqare or rectangle. When you have a slope, it is when you may have to do some calculations using formulas like A^2 + B^2 = C^2 to find the hypothenues.</p>

			<h1>Building Roofing with the right Java Version</h1>

			<h1>AddOns</h1>
			<section>
				<p>When working with addons, such as dormers and entry addOns, one important variable is the addOnRoofIndex. It determines what type of addon was added and is depended on in order to grab the correct quantity (addOnQty) for the correct addOn type.</p>
				<p>
				There is a way to know what addOn was selected and to know how to grab the correct addOnQty. Check out flashing, and search for addOnRoofIndex != null. That snippet of code is used to select and figure out how many addons are being added.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The way how addOn materials are estimated is quite weird. If you select an addOn selection and enter 9 for qty, the code does not loop through that addOn (Dormer, Entry, etc) class 9 times, it only loops once. Example: If you choose addOn type A and choose qty of 4. That counts as one selection of addOn. If you continue through and proceed to select again another addon, say addOn A again and choose qty of 5, it is now 2 counts of addOn selection. So the code will loop now twice. But inside each loop, it will use the corresponding qty 4 or 5, which ever addOn selection it is on. If you choose to add another addOn selection, say addOn B with 2 qty. The total loop will now become 3, with the third loop having 3 as the multiplier.

				It also plays part in returning the saved design id for later recall.
				EstimateId is usually called at the very last screen before saving a design so the right estimation data can be processed to the correct
				 place.</p>
				<p>One way to know what app has what estimate Id, Check the appConfig.properties for dev/stage/prod and look for sourceIdRoofing</p>
				<p>Like Flooring, there are 3 sections in Roofing: Roofing, gutter, soffit/fasica.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section class="box">
				<h2>Design Id</h2>
				<p>Design id is retrieved by using com.menards.storeservice.client.impl.StoreServiceClient.</p>
				<p>Store service is set by StoreServiceClient storeServiceClient = 
				new StoreServiceClient(storeServiceWsdlURL, userName, password, authType, true)</p>
				<p>These values are stored in the app config and called into the session to be stored at runtime</p>
				<p>When you get the store client, you generate the design id by through the createEstimate method</p>
				<p>
				estimateID = (int)storeServiceClient.createEstimate(Integer.parseInt(storeNumber), estimateInfoMap, guestBillToMap, itemInfo, null);
				</p>

				<h2>What class</h2>
				<p>appConfig.properties is where the value is stored. StatsLogging.java determines what estimate id is set at the very begining
				 of the app. KisokServerClient.java gets the correct estimateId value for roofing,soffit, or gutter at the print summary when
				 print is pressed.</p>
