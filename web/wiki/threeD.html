		<h1>3D Java</h1>
		<section>
		<p>This is an inhouse framework developed by our team years ago. All our JAVA apps currently use it for 3D viewings. Our legacy C++ apps use a different framework for 3D.</p>
		<p>Once our new webapps roll out, we will be replacing our in-house 3D framework with the new Unity Engine. Three.js framework was initially proposed but Unity will take over.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>Hint</h1>
			<p>If you need to modify or change something on the java app, ask yourself if this is a change on a certain screen, if so start by looking for the correct XML screen, from there it may be the center source to get to all other functions and screens</p>
