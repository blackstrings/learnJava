		<p>If you need to investigate an issue with the kiosks at a particular store there are a few ways to go about it.
		First check what store # it is through using myMenards lookup. Then use filezilla to get the PC's dns or ip.
		You can use pcAnywhere (start > all programs > symantec > pcA Quick Connect) <a href="ftp.html">Instructions</a> into it and check if the pc has the correct version installed.</p>
		
		<p>
		Past issue example: the kiosk was not displaying the contents correctly due to the PC not haveing enterprise mode installed/enabled which seems to be an imaging thing.
		So imaging was emailed to install enterprise mode on these PCs.
