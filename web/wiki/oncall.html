		<h1>On Call</h1>
		<p>
		Every Monday, a new team memeber gets the on call phone to handle any problems that may arrise at the store. Most calls will be from the help desk at the general office. The procedure is typically the store gets an issue and will call the help desk at the general office. The help desk will then call the On Call phone that they best think can help resolve the issue. The help desk has many phones, so when calling the help desk back, you may NOT reach the same person, so keep that in mind. One way to go around this is to make sure you get the help desk person at the time, their information as much as you can, so you can reach them back.
		</p>
		
		<p>Sometimes it could be a direct call from the store with an expensive estimate. If you do not know what to do, call the team lead or primary people</li>
